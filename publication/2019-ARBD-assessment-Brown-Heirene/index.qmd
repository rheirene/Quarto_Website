**Abstract**

**Background and aims:** Recent investigations have highlighted the value of neuropsychological testing for the assessment and screening of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the suitability of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) for this purpose.

**Methods:** Comparing 28 participants with ARBD (11 with Korsakoff's Syndrome and 17 with the umbrella "ARBD" diagnosis) and 30 alcohol-dependent participants without ARBD (ALs) we calculated Area Under the Curve (*AUC*) statistics, sensitivity and specificity values, base-rate adjusted predictive valueblogs, and likelihood ratios for both tests.

**Results:** High levels of screening accuracy were found for the total scores of both the ACE-III (*AUC* = .823, 95% CIs \[.714, .932\], *SE* = .056; optimal cut-off ≤86: sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 73%) and RBANS (*AUC* = .846, 95% CIs \[.746, .947\], *SE* = .052; optimal cut-off ≤83: sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 67%) at multiple cut-off points. Removing participants with a history of polysubstance from the samples (10 ALs and 1 ARBD) improved the diagnostic capabilities of the RBANS substantially (*AUC* = .915, 95% CIs \[.831, .999\], *SE* = .043; optimal cut-off ≤85: sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 80%), while only minor improvements to the ACE-III's accuracy were observed (*AUC* = .854, 95% CIs \[.744, .963\], *SE* = .056; optimal cut-off ≤88: sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 75%).

**Conclusions:** Overall, both the ACE-III and RBANS are suitable tools for ARBD screening within an alcohol-dependent population, though the RBANS is the superior of the two. Clinicians using these tools for ARBD screening should be cautious of false-positive outcomes and should therefore combine them with other assessment methods (e.g., neuroimaging, clinical observations) and more detailed neuropsychological testing before reaching diagnostic decisions."
