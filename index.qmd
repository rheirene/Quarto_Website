## Latest research findings

[Collaborative commentary: The UK's gambling affordability checks]{style="color: #289998; font-weight: bold;"}

I recently read Philip Newall and David Zendle's excellent [article](https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16571) in which they used banking data to examine the relationship between gambling expenditure and harm. After reading their conclusion regarding the potential impact of an 'affordability check' policy, I wrote to them with some comments about how they could adapt their analyses to more directly evaluate the policy. 

This led to a very cordial discussion and to [my comments being published in *Addiction*](https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16635) alongside their article. The authors then re-analysed their outcomes in line with my suggestions and published a great [response](https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16657). 

[Evaluating gambling study pre-registrations]{style="color: #289998; font-weight: bold;"}

Our meta-scientific review of pre-registrations for gambling studies is finally published in *Meta-Psychology*. This journal has one of the highest TOP (Transparency and Openness Promotion) scores of any field and so I'm excited to have our work published there. The manuscript we submitted was computationally produced from R code and all data and materials are publicly available---find out more [here](https://robheirene.netlify.app/publication/2024-preregistration-evaluation-Heirene/). 

## What I'm working on

[Lots to do with online gambling in Australia]{style="color: #289998; font-weight: bold;"}

My colleagues and I are working on a large project that fuses people's survey responses with their online gambling account data to answer lots of interesting research questions... more soon!
