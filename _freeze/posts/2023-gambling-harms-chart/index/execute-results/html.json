So, rather than drifting with the tide of publishing pressure, I want to steer in a direction that helps me towards this goal.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm thinking about problem gambling prevention a lot at the moment and where to place my focus. To help with this, I've started mapping all the existing harm prevention strategies used in practice or proposed in the literature.\n\nTo make this process a little more interesting for me and anyone who reads this, I've been playing around with the `plotly` R package to present my catalogue of prevention strategies in a visual and interactive way.\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Work in progress\n\nPlease note that I've only just started making the interactive chart and I'm conscious that it currently provides a **very incomplete picture** of the strategies available. I will be reading around and adding more strategies and information over the next few months (starting July 2023).\n\nThat said, if you know a prevention strategy I've missed, please feel free to let me know using the comments section at the end or [send me an email](mailto:robheirene@gmail.com) :)\n:::\n\n### Prevention strategies visualised\n\nBelow is the catalogue of prevention strategies I have so far, visualised as a sunburst chart. Again, it's just a start, and I'm building it publicly so feel free to get in touch with ideas.\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Recreating the chart\n\nI've included the `R code` used to create the chart in the drop-down sections below. Feel free to recreate it (the data are on the [Github repo](https://github.com/rheirene/Quarto_Website) for this site), but please credit me if you do.\n:::\n\nHover over each category or strategy to read my preliminary descriptions, and [click on the bars to see more]{style=\"color:#289998; font-weight: bold;\"}.

This section is even more undeveloped than the chart, so the same call for suggestions applies.\n\nThere will eventually be a lot of information presented here, so I've hidden the text for each prevention strategy inside expandable boxes for easier navigation.\n\n#### Consumer protection tools\n\n#### Restrictions\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"simple\" icon=\"false\"}\n##### Global loss limits\n\n-   A survey (n = 2352) of Norsk Tipping (a Norwegian Government-owned gambling operator) customers' perspectives on the recently implemented global loss limit of NOK 20,000 per month ([Auer et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-018-9892-x))\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"simple\" icon=\"false\"}\n##### Max bet amounts\n\n-   This [UK Gambling Commission report](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/guide/consumer-voice-2020-exploring-online-staking) discusses consumer perspectives on stake limits (n=32). Qual/quant survey with PGSI scores.\n\n-   It seems that a lot of online gambling sites indirectly impose stake limits by having maximum payout amounts (e.g., Â£100,000). Payout limits vary from site to to site and across activities, but these operator-protecting restrictions (which are sometimes reduced for big winners...) can limit customer stakes .
