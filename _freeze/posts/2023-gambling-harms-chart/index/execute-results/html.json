I want to do research that adds real value to the world.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm thinking about problem gambling prevention a lot at the moment and where to place my focus. To help with this, I've started mapping all the existing harm prevention strategies used in practice or proposed in the gambling literature.\n\n### Prevention strategies visualised\n\nTo make this process a little more interesting for me and anyone who reads this, I've been playing around with the `plotly` R package to present my catalogue of prevention strategies in a visual and interactive way.\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Work in progress\n\nPlease note that I've only just started making the interactive chart and I'm conscious that it currently provides a **very incomplete picture** of the strategies available. I will be reading around and adding more strategies and information over the next few months (starting July 2023).\n\nThat said, please feel free to suggest some strategies or edits using the comments section at the end (or you can [send me an email](mailto:robheirene@gmail.com)).\n:::\n\nBelow is what I have so far, visualised as a sunburst chart. Hover over each category or strategy to reveal descriptions of each, and [**click on the bars to see more**]{style=\"color:#289998; font-weight: bold;\"}. It's best viewed on a pc/mac or tablet, **not** on mobile.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show set-up code\"}\n# Install and load the groundhog package to ensure consistency of the package versions used here:\n# install.packages(\"groundhog\") # Install\n\nlibrary(groundhog) # Load\n\n# List desired packages:\npackages <- c('tidyverse', # Clean, organise, and visualise data\n              'plotly', # Add interactive elements to figures\n              'sysfonts', # Special fonts for figures\n              'showtext', # Special fonts for figures\n              'htmlwidgets') # Make plotly plots HTML format for rendering in Quarto\n              \n\n# Load desired package with versions specific to project start date:\ngroundhog.library(packages, \"2023-06-05\") # Set Slightly earlier than start date as some of the plotly dependency packages wouldn't load properly with date as 07/07/2023\n\n# Load new font for figures/graphs\nfont_add_google(\"Poppins\")\nshowtext_auto()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code used to create chart\"}\n# Load manually input data:\ngam_prevention_data<- read.csv(\"gamb_prevention_data.csv\") %>%\n  select(Layer:Description) # Warning, something as simple as an apostrophe and this dataset can cause it to not play nice\n\n# gam_prevention_data<- read.csv(\"posts/2023-gambling-harms-chart/gamb_prevention_data.csv\") %>% select(Layer:Description)\n\n# Make sunburst chart:\ngam_prevention_sunburst<- plot_ly(gam_prevention_data,\n                                   ids = ~IDs,\n                                   labels = ~Label,\n                                   parents = ~Parents,\n                                   hoverinfo = \"text\",  # Needed for below argument to work\n                                   hovertext = ~Description,\n                                   type = 'sunburst',\n                                   maxdepth = 3,\n                                   insidetextorientation = 'radial',\n                                   marker = list(line = list(width = 5, color = '#002B36')),  # Adjust border size + color\n                                   sort = TRUE) %>%\n   plotly::layout(colorway = c(\"#289998\", \"#287699\", \"#A87998\", \"#A6A6A6\", \"#FFF7E7\", \"#65BBA3\", \"#62A899\", \"#998F28\",  \"#986289\", \"#289970\"),\n         font = list(\n           # family = \"Poppins\", # I can't get this to work so let me know if you can!\n                     color = \"#FFF7E7\"), # Set main font so the central layer text can be seen\n         paper_bgcolor = '#002B36', # background consistent with site\n         plot_bgcolor = '#002B36',\n        hoverlabel = list(font = list(size = 12)))  # Increase the font size for hover text)\n\n# Save plot as a HTML file (it doesn't render well with quarto otherwise):\nsaveWidget(gam_prevention_sunburst, 'fig.html')\n```\n:::\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"fig.html\" class=\"fade-inhtml\" width=\"100%\" height=\"750\" style=\"border:none;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Recreating the chart\n\nI've included the `R code` used to create the chart in the drop-down sections just above it. Feel free to recreate it (the data are on the [Github repo](https://github.com/rheirene/Quarto_Website) for this site) or adapt the code to your own chart, but please credit me if you do :)\n:::\n\n### The evidence\n\nAs I (re-)read the literature on this topic, I'm also creating a record of relevant studies and resources relating to each prevention strategy. **This section is even less developed than the chart, so the same call for suggestions applies.**\n\nThere will eventually be a lot of information presented here, so I've hidden the text for each prevention strategy inside expandable boxes for easier navigation.\n\n#### Consumer protection tools\n\n#### Restrictions\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"simple\" icon=\"false\"}\n##### Global loss limits\n\n-   A survey (n = 2352) of Norsk Tipping (a Norwegian Government-owned gambling operator) customers' perspectives on the recently implemented global loss limit of NOK 20,000 per month ([Auer et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-018-9892-x))\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"simple\" icon=\"false\"}\n##### Global stake limits\n\n-   This [UK Gambling Commission report](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/guide/consumer-voice-2020-exploring-online-staking) from 2020 discusses consumer perspectives on stake limits (n=32). Qual/quant survey with PGSI scores.\n\n-   It seems that a lot of online gambling sites indirectly impose stake limits by having maximum payout amounts (e.g., £100,000). Payout limits vary from site to to site and across activities, but these operator-protecting restrictions (which are sometimes reduced for big winners...) can limit customer stakes .

Existing bet 365 customers about deposit limits were randomly selected to be sent prompts encouraging them to set limits between January--April 2020. 1,731 participants split roughly evenly across the 3 arms set limits. Customers in the control (arm 1) group set the highest limits (Mdn = £14.3, M = £1601), followed by those in the reduced anchor group (arm 2; Mdn = £8.3, M = £230.8), and the free-text box group (arm 3; Mdn = £7.1, M = £308.78). Customers in the 2nd and 3rd arm were slightly more likely to remove their limit in the trial period, but the difference was not statistically significant.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n```{=html}\n<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\"\n        data-repo=\"rheirene/Quarto_Website\"\n        data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOJ0d4fA\"\n        data-category-id=\"DIC_kwDOJ0d4fM4CXv7I\"\n        data-mapping=\"pathname\"\n        data-strict=\"0\"\n        data-reactions-enabled=\"1\"\n        data-emit-metadata=\"0\"\n        data-input-position=\"bottom\"\n        data-theme=\"dark_dimmed\"\n        data-lang=\"en\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n```\n",
