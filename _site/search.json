    "section": "",
    "text": "When I was a teenager the received wisdom was that, for every alcoholic drink imbibed, 100 brain cells died. In 2016 when I started my PhD looking at the assessment and treatment of alcohol-related brain damage, I searched eagerly for the origin of this factoid and had no luck finding it.\nUnsurprisingly, the relationship between alcohol consumption and brain damage is far more complex than the agreeably simple “1 drink = 100 brain cells killed” formula.\nHere I provide a brief overview of the evidence in this area as a starting point for those interested in how alcohol use—from the occasional glass of wine to twenty or more drinks a week—affects our brain health.\n\n\nIn the last 12 years (from 2020), six large-scale systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Anstey, et al., 2009; Brennan et al., 2020; Neafsey & Collins, 2011; Panza et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2008; Rehm, et al., 2019) have combined the findings of studies investigating the association between alcohol consumption and adverse neurocognitive outcomes (e.g., neurodegenerative disorders like dementia) while accounting for other variables associated with drinking level (e.g., educational attainment). While each review used slightly different study inclusion criteria and key outcomes of interest, the overall message returned by all six is clear: the relationship between consumption and brain health appears to resemble an inverted J shape (see figure below.\n\n\n\nWhat evidence tells us about the typical relationship between consumption and brain health. Note: this is a simplification!\n\n\nTo clarify, light to moderate alcohol consumption (≤2 standard drinks a day for men; ≤1 for women1) seems to have positive effects on brain health and heavier consumption (defined varyingly as either ≥3 or ≥4 drinks per day) has negative effects. More specifically, low-moderate drinkers have a significantly reduced risk of dementia and cognitive decline compared to non-drinkers, while heavy drinkers have an increased risk of these outcomes.\n\n\n\nNo, unfortunately not. While the inverted J shape relationship is useful for describing alcohol’s effects at the collective level, the relationship between consumption and brain health is influenced by a whole range of factors other than just the amount consumed at the individual level.\nSome factors thought to moderate the relationship:\n\nThe type of alcohol: drinking wine at low-moderate levels may have a more protective effect than beer or spirits (Neafsey & Collins, 2011), but this is very controversial.\nAge: older adults are more vulnerable alcohol’s damaging effects and exhibit slower cognitive recovery rates (Bates et al., 2002).\nEducation: there’s a general sense in the literature that education protects against alcohol-related cognitive decline. Well-educated heavy drinkers score higher on cognitive screening tests than those with fewer years of education (Alarcon et al., 2015), but this could be due to a higher baseline cognitive ability rather than a lack of decline, as such.\nSex: women may be more likely to experience cognitive impairment at lower levels of consumption (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004).\nGenetic variants: individuals who possess the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele (associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s dementia) don’t appear to experience the potential cognitive benefits associated with low-moderate alcohol consumption (Neafsey & Collins, 2011; Panza et al., 2012)2.\n\n\n\nSocio-economic status: low socioeconomic status is associated with increased alcohol harm (Johnco & Draper, 2015), including poorer cognitive outcomes than those with higher socioeconomic status who consume the same amounts of alcohol (Sabia et al., 2011) 3.\n\nSome factors known to mediate the relationship\nIt also helps to know the ways through which alcohol damages the brain (the mediating factors):\n\nNutritional deficiencies: perhaps the most important mediating factor. A deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1) causes Wernicke-Korsakoff’s Syndrome (colloquially known as “alcoholic wet brain”), a severe, life-long disorder characterised by crippling amnesia. Alcohol impairs the body’s ability to absorb and utilise thiamine, which is required for several neurological processes4. Insufficient thiamine is perhaps the most worrying deficiency associated with alcohol misuse (being both common and severe in consequence), but deficiencies in several other vitamins and minerals (e.g., vitamins B2, B3, B6, & B9, zinc, magnesium) are common and each has their own set of negative neurological consequences5.\nLiver dysfunction: we all know that alcohol is bad news for the liver, but few know that a dysfunctional liver is bad news for the brain. When damaged by excessive alcohol use, the liver becomes unable to properly process neurotoxic compounds, allowing them to enter the bloodstream and eventually to migrate past the blood-brain barrier. Granted access to the brain, toxins like ammonia have pernicious effects on our neurophysiology and are linked to the disorder Hepatic Encephalopathy.\n\n\n\n\nDespite the findings of the reviews discussed earlier, restraint should be exercised before we declare that drinking low-moderate levels of alcohol has positive effects on brain function. In fact, authors in four of the reviews (Anstey et al., 2009; Panza et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2008; Rehm et al., 2019) suggest a cautious interpretation of their findings regarding low-moderate use as, even with their careful selection procedures, heterogeneity existed across the studies reviewed (e.g., inconsistencies in accounting for potential confounding variables & contradictory findings).\nIt’s also important to consider that the studies reviewed imply only an association between low-moderate alcohol consumption and cognitive health, and no causal link has been definitively established6.\nWhat’s more, not all studies find positive associations between low levels of drinking and brain health. A recent investigation that accounted for multiple confounding variables (e.g., intelligence, socioeconomic status) found a dose-dependent relationship between low-moderate consumption and neuroimaging evidence of brain damage (Topiwala et al., 2017; see also: Hassing, 2018). A recent review also found increased levels of iron deposits in the brains of people who drink just seven or more units of alcohol a week (high levels of iron in the brain are linked to neurodegeneration, as well as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease; Topiwala et al., 2022).\nWhile the functional implications of the observed brain changes in both studies are not fully known (i.e., we don’t know what they actually mean for our memory, attention etc.), the findings question the purported ‘neuroprotective’ effect of moderate alcohol consumption proposed by some (Neafsey & Collins, 2011).\n\n\n\nIn contrast to low-moderate alcohol consumption, little-to-no controversy surrounds the well-established relationship between heavy alcohol use and adverse neurocognitive outcomes. This was clearly evidenced in a large-scale analysis of over 31,000,000 adult hospital admissions in France between 2008 and 2013 which found Alcohol-Use Disorders (AUDs; i.e., the American Psychiatric Association’s term for alcohol dependence) were the strongest risk factor (of 34 [e.g., head injury; heart failure]) for all types of dementia, particularly early-onset dementia (Schwarzinger et al., 2018).\nMultiple studies have observed impaired cognitive performance and reduced brain region volumes in those with AUDs compared with demographically matched (i.e., same age, gender etc.) healthy individuals (Fama et al., 2017; Moritz et al., 2018; Pitel et al., 2007; Pitel et al., 2008; Rolland et al., 2019). Most of these studies are poor at reporting the levels of alcohol use in their participants, though one reports an average daily consumption of 20 standard drinks per day (range = 7-48) for an average of 20 years (range = 5-35; Pitel et al., 2007).\nThere is evience that with abstinence, improvements are seen in cognition (Crowe et al., 2019; Stavro et al., 2013) and brain structure (Bartsch et al., 2007; Gazdzinski et al., 2010), implicating alcohol misuse as the cause of these impairments.\n\n\n\nBinge drinking (defined as consuming ≥6 drinks in one sitting) has received less attention in this context. The few existing studies have found binge drinkers (who are varyingly defined by their scores on questions relating to how frequently they binge drink/become drunk), when compared with non-binge drinkers, display poorer performance on tests of executive function (Salas-Gomez et al., 2016), working memory (Squeglia et al., 2011), and visuosptaial abilities (Townshend & Duka, 2005).\nPreliminary evidence also indicates that starting to binge drink at a younger age is associated with poorer cognitive test scores later in life (Salas-Gomez et al., 2016), suggesting an accumulating effect on cognition.\nSome caution is warranted, however, when considering this body of evidence: most studies so far have focused exclusively on adolescent/young adult populations and have used cross-sectional designs (cf. Mota et al, 2013) which make it difficult to infer cause and effect.\nIt may be premature to conclude that binge drinking causes poor cognitive performance—lower cognitive ability could increase the likelihood of someone binge drinking.\nThat said... a recent study with pre- and post-drinking data sheds some more light on this and answers a question I’ve always been interested in: What happens to our brains when we drink extremely heavily, say on our 21st birthday celebration? Well, this study looked at just that and, with the lead author’s permission, I’ve shared their helpful info-graphic describing the study below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is a safe level of alcohol consumption for our brains? In reverse order:\n\nThe jury is still out on the exact consequences of long-term binge drinking, but it certainly doesn’t appear to be good for the brain and preliminary evidence urges caution.\nDrinking at heavy levels (&gt;2 drinks per day consistently) is definitely not safe. Don’t do it.\nDrinking at low-moderate levels (1-2 drinks a day) is unlikely to be harmful for most people, and may (note the emphasis) even have beneficial effects on brain health7. But ultimately, none (zero, zilch, nada) is the only level we can say with absolute certainty is safe for our brain.\n\nA boring, trite conclusion, I know, but it’s the truth. Sorry.\nPlease get in touch on Twitter or using the form on the main page of my site with any comments or questions regarding this post. This is a controversial topic and I welcome any feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see the full reference list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnstey, K. J., Jorm, A.

While the inverted J shape relationship is useful for describing alcohol’s effects at the collective level, the relationship between consumption and brain health is influenced by a whole range of factors other than just the amount consumed at the individual level.\nSome factors thought to moderate the relationship:\n\nThe type of alcohol: drinking wine at low-moderate levels may have a more protective effect than beer or spirits (Neafsey & Collins, 2011), but this is very controversial.\nAge: older adults are more vulnerable alcohol’s damaging effects and exhibit slower cognitive recovery rates (Bates et al., 2002).\nEducation: there’s a general sense in the literature that education protects against alcohol-related cognitive decline. Well-educated heavy drinkers score higher on cognitive screening tests than those with fewer years of education (Alarcon et al., 2015), but this could be due to a higher baseline cognitive ability rather than a lack of decline, as such.\nSex: women may be more likely to experience cognitive impairment at lower levels of consumption (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004).\nGenetic variants: individuals who possess the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele (associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s dementia) don’t appear to experience the potential cognitive benefits associated with low-moderate alcohol consumption (Neafsey & Collins, 2011; Panza et al., 2012)2.\n\n\n\nSocio-economic status: low socioeconomic status is associated with increased alcohol harm (Johnco & Draper, 2015), including poorer cognitive outcomes than those with higher socioeconomic status who consume the same amounts of alcohol (Sabia et al., 2011) 3.\n\nSome factors known to mediate the relationship\nIt also helps to know the ways through which alcohol damages the brain (the mediating factors):\n\nNutritional deficiencies: perhaps the most important mediating factor. A deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1) causes Wernicke-Korsakoff’s Syndrome (colloquially known as “alcoholic wet brain”), a severe, life-long disorder characterised by crippling amnesia. Alcohol impairs the body’s ability to absorb and utilise thiamine, which is required for several neurological processes4. Insufficient thiamine is perhaps the most worrying deficiency associated with alcohol misuse (being both common and severe in consequence), but deficiencies in several other vitamins and minerals (e.g., vitamins B2, B3, B6, & B9, zinc, magnesium) are common and each has their own set of negative neurological consequences5.\nLiver dysfunction: we all know that alcohol is bad news for the liver, but few know that a dysfunctional liver is bad news for the brain. When damaged by excessive alcohol use, the liver becomes unable to properly process neurotoxic compounds, allowing them to enter the bloodstream and eventually to migrate past the blood-brain barrier. Granted access to the brain, toxins like ammonia have pernicious effects on our neurophysiology and are linked to the disorder Hepatic Encephalopathy.\n\n\n\n\nDespite the findings of the reviews discussed earlier, restraint should be exercised before we declare that drinking low-moderate levels of alcohol has positive effects on brain function. In fact, authors in four of the reviews (Anstey et al., 2009; Panza et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2008; Rehm et al., 2019) suggest a cautious interpretation of their findings regarding low-moderate use as, even with their careful selection procedures, heterogeneity existed across the studies reviewed (e.g., inconsistencies in accounting for potential confounding variables & contradictory findings).\nIt’s also important to consider that the studies reviewed imply only an association between low-moderate alcohol consumption and cognitive health, and no causal link has been definitively established6.\nWhat’s more, not all studies find positive associations between low levels of drinking and brain health. A recent investigation that accounted for multiple confounding variables (e.g., intelligence, socioeconomic status) found a dose-dependent relationship between low-moderate consumption and neuroimaging evidence of brain damage (Topiwala et al., 2017; see also: Hassing, 2018). A recent review also found increased levels of iron deposits in the brains of people who drink just seven or more units of alcohol a week (high levels of iron in the brain are linked to neurodegeneration, as well as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease; Topiwala et al., 2022).\nWhile the functional implications of the observed brain changes in both studies are not fully known (i.e., we don’t know what they actually mean for our memory, attention etc.), the findings question the purported ‘neuroprotective’ effect of moderate alcohol consumption proposed by some (Neafsey & Collins, 2011).\n\n\n\nIn contrast to low-moderate alcohol consumption, little-to-no controversy surrounds the well-established relationship between heavy alcohol use and adverse neurocognitive outcomes. This was clearly evidenced in a large-scale analysis of over 31,000,000 adult hospital admissions in France between 2008 and 2013 which found Alcohol-Use Disorders (AUDs; i.e., the American Psychiatric Association’s term for alcohol dependence) were the strongest risk factor (of 34 [e.g., head injury; heart failure]) for all types of dementia, particularly early-onset dementia (Schwarzinger et al., 2018).\nMultiple studies have observed impaired cognitive performance and reduced brain region volumes in those with AUDs compared with demographically matched (i.e., same age, gender etc.) healthy individuals (Fama et al., 2017; Moritz et al., 2018; Pitel et al., 2007; Pitel et al., 2008; Rolland et al., 2019). Most of these studies are poor at reporting the levels of alcohol use in their participants, though one reports an average daily consumption of 20 standard drinks per day (range = 7-48) for an average of 20 years (range = 5-35; Pitel et al., 2007).\nThere is evience that with abstinence, improvements are seen in cognition (Crowe et al., 2019; Stavro et al., 2013) and brain structure (Bartsch et al., 2007; Gazdzinski et al., 2010), implicating alcohol misuse as the cause of these impairments.\n\n\n\nBinge drinking (defined as consuming ≥6 drinks in one sitting) has received less attention in this context. The few existing studies have found binge drinkers (who are varyingly defined by their scores on questions relating to how frequently they binge drink/become drunk), when compared with non-binge drinkers, display poorer performance on tests of executive function (Salas-Gomez et al., 2016), working memory (Squeglia et al., 2011), and visuosptaial abilities (Townshend & Duka, 2005).\nPreliminary evidence also indicates that starting to binge drink at a younger age is associated with poorer cognitive test scores later in life (Salas-Gomez et al., 2016), suggesting an accumulating effect on cognition.\nSome caution is warranted, however, when considering this body of evidence: most studies so far have focused exclusively on adolescent/young adult populations and have used cross-sectional designs (cf. Mota et al, 2013) which make it difficult to infer cause and effect.\nIt may be premature to conclude that binge drinking causes poor cognitive performance—lower cognitive ability could increase the likelihood of someone binge drinking.\nThat said... a recent study with pre- and post-drinking data sheds some more light on this and answers a question I’ve always been interested in: What happens to our brains when we drink extremely heavily, say on our 21st birthday celebration? Well, this study looked at just that and, with the lead author’s permission, I’ve shared their helpful info-graphic describing the study below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is a safe level of alcohol consumption for our brains? In reverse order:\n\nThe jury is still out on the exact consequences of long-term binge drinking, but it certainly doesn’t appear to be good for the brain and preliminary evidence urges caution.\nDrinking at heavy levels (&gt;2 drinks per day consistently) is definitely not safe. Don’t do it.\nDrinking at low-moderate levels (1-2 drinks a day) is unlikely to be harmful for most people, and may (note the emphasis) even have beneficial effects on brain health7. But ultimately, none (zero, zilch, nada) is the only level we can say with absolute certainty is safe for our brain.\n\nA boring, trite conclusion, I know, but it’s the truth.

For more information click here.↩︎\nIt’s not all bad news for those with this genetic variant—a recent study of 337,484(!) participants supported the variant’s connection with Alzheimer’s, but also concluded that “ε4-associated disease protection was seen against obesity, chronic airway obstruction, type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, and liver disease”.↩︎\nThis effect extends beyond neurological harm to other physical and mental health consequences of alcohol consumption, and is referred to as the “alcohol harm paradox”. There’s no definitive explanation for why it occurs, but it could be due to differences in drinking patterns and other lifestyle behaviours (sleep, diet, exercise etc.) between the most and least disadvantaged (see here for a review of this topic).↩︎\nAfter it’s internally converted to Thiamine pyrophosphate.↩︎\nSome supporting citations for (mostly older) studies investigating nutritional deficiencies in those with alcohol use disorders: (Bogden & Troiano, 1978; Carrilho, Santos, Piasecki, & Jorge, 2013; Cook et al., 1991; Flink, 1986; Shane & Flink, 1991; Spiegel & Jim, 2011; Thomson, 2000; Thomson, Jeyasingham, Pratt, & Shaw, 1987).↩︎\nWelch argued in 2017 that no single convincing neuroprotective mechanism underlying moderate alcohol consumption has been elucidated (Welch, 2017). Although, it has been hypothesised that the positive effects on cardiovascular health may be one way through which moderate consumption may reduce the risk of cognitive decline (Anstey et al., 2009). More recently, a study of mice found that low levels of alcohol consumption improved function of the glymphatic system, which is responsible for clearing waste products (including potentially toxic proteins that have been implicated in the aetiology of neurodegenerative disorders) from intercellular space in the central nervous system (Lundgaard et al., 2018). The authors found a clear inverted J relationship between consumption and glymphatic system function.↩︎\nIt’s important to note that this post focuses solely on brain health and ignores the effect that drinking alcohol has on other aspects of health. While low levels of alcohol use may be harmless for brain function, this may not be the case for say, liver function and cancer risk. Also, one clear exception to the “low levels are probably okay” conclusion is pregnancy. A recent study by University of Sydney Researchers found clear evidence that no level of alcohol use during pregnancy is safe.↩︎"

    "text": "An increasing number of new (and often bizarre) forms of addiction have been proposed in recent years, including addictions to video gaming, dancing, tanning, exercise, extreme sports (based largely on work by myself and colleagues), shopping, Instagram, Tinder, flying (yes, travelling in a plane), fortune telling, and even yourself.\nNaturally, this has led to fears that we may be “over pathologizing” everyday behaviours and that the term addiction may lose meaning if it continues to be applied so liberally (Billieux et al., 2015). However, what the defining features of an addiction actually are is a surprisingly contentious subject. Both addiction experts and those with lived experience of addiction disagree within and between their groups about what it means to be “addicted” (Walters & Gilbert, 2000).\nIn this two-part post, I summarise some of the key ways in which addiction has been defined. I try to provide some clarity on what it means to be addicted and how it differs from simply doing a lot of something."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nI find the components model to be a useful blueprint when considering the core principles of addiction, but I would argue that all six components do not need to be present for someone to be classified as having an addiction (relapse and conflict and/or salience are key). Similar to the argument made by Kardefelt-Winther et al. (2017), some of these symptoms (especially, tolerance and withdrawal) may be less relevant to some behavioural addictions and may therefore not be necessary for classification, though I would diverge from Kardefelt-Winther and colleagues by arguing that the greater the number of “components” an individual displays (including tolerance & withdrawal) the stronger the case for declaring that they are addicted. On the removal of tolerance and withdrawal from the core criteria of addiction, Griffiths (2017) remarked: “Ironically, removing these from core addiction criteria may actually increase the prevalence of everyday leisure activities being labelled as an addiction.”↩︎\nKardefelt-Winther et al. (2017) make several more criticisms of the Components Model and the confirmatory approach to studying behavioural addictions, but the three I cover here are (I believe) the core arguments. See their article for more detail.↩︎\nThat said, their exclusion criteria listed below this point (i.e., “The functional impairment results from an activity that, although potentially harmful, is the consequence of a wilful choice”) could be said to introduce impaired control into their operational definition↩︎\nSome may accuse me of “over pathologizing” normal behaviour, given my research on the parallels between extreme sports athletes and those with drug and behavioural addictions. However, I don’t think we ever argued that extreme sports athletes are addicted in the exact same way as those who suffer drug or non-drug addictions (and we certainly didn’t aim to pathologize extreme sports athletes); rather, we pointed out that there are qualitative similarities in the experiences between these groups. That said, I would perhaps be slightly more circumspect when making such comparisons and using addiction terminology if I were writing those papers today↩︎"

At the end, I come to a provisional definition of addiction that incorporates features from all of the different definitional approaches discussed."

Many of us drink alcohol or do other things at a level we would not consider extreme, but that can still lead to mild social and/or occupational problems, and yet continue to do so. Similarly, repeated but unsuccessful attempts to stop eating junk food or to start exercising more are characteristic of most of us—are we demonstrating a level of impaired control in the same way? Addictions are characterised by disruptive and destructive patterns of behaviour that exceed the relatively inconsequential mistakes and foibles of most.↩︎\nImpaired control could be a candidate symptom for defining addiction on its own (the medical expression would be that the symptom is “pathognomonic of addiction”).

Research suggests during abstinence these athletes may experience withdrawal states characteristic of individuals with an addiction (Celsi, Rose, & Leigh, 1993; Franken, Zijlstra, & Muris, 2006; Willig, 2008). Despite this notion, no research has directly explored withdrawal experiences of extreme sports athletes.\nMethods: Using semi-structured interviews, we explored withdrawal experiences of high (n = 4) and average-ability (n = 4) male rock climbers during periods of abstinence. We investigated the psychological and behavioral aspects of withdrawal, including craving, anhedonia, and negative affect; and differences in the frequency and intensity of these states between groups.\nResults: Deductive content analysis indicated support for each of the three categories of anhedonia, craving, and negative affect. Consistent with existing substance addiction literature, high-ability climbers recalled more frequent and intense craving states and negative affect during abstinence compared with average-ability climbers. No differences in anhedonic symptoms between high and average-ability participants were found.\nConclusions: Rock climbing athletes appear to experience withdrawal symptoms when abstinent from their sport comparable to individuals with substance and behavioral addictions.

The aim of this protocol is to outline the methodology for a systematic review that aims to identify the neuropsychological tools being used to assess cognitive impairments in individuals with ARBD and evaluate their efficacy within this context. We will search a number of online databases and other sources to identify studies using a neuropsychological tool in the screening, diagnosis or neuropsychological assessment of individuals with ARBD.

The present systematic review aimed to synthesize and discuss the evidence appraising the neuropsychological tests used to assess ARCI in order to support clinicians and researchers in selecting appropriate tests for use with this population.\nMethods: We searched for studies investigating the psychometric, diagnostic and practical values of tools used in the screening, diagnosis, and assessment of Korsakoff’s Syndrome (KS), Alcohol-Related Dementia (ARD), and those with a specific diagnosis of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). The following databases were searched in March 2016 and again in August 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psych-INFO, ProQuest Psychology, and Science Direct. Study quality was assessed using a checklist designed by the authors to evaluate the specific factors contributing to robust and clearly reported studies in this area. A total of 43 studies were included following the screening of 3646 studies by title and abstract and 360 at full-text. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity in the tests and ARCI samples investigated in the studies reviewed. Instead, review findings were narratively synthesized and divided according to five domains of assessment: cognitive screening, memory, executive function, intelligence and test batteries, and premorbid ability. Effect sizes (d) were calculated to supplement findings.\nResults: Overall, several measures demonstrated sensitivity to the cognitive deficits associated with chronic alcoholism and an ability to differentiate between gradations of impairment. However, findings relating to the other psychometric qualities of the tests, including those important for the accurate assessment and monitoring of ARCI (e.g., test-retest reliability), were entirely absent or limited. Additionally, the synthesis of neuropsychological outcomes presented here supports the recent impetus for a move away from discrete diagnoses (e.g., KS, ARD) and the distinctions between them toward more broad and inclusive diagnostic conceptualizations of ARCI, thereby recognizing the heterogeneity in presentation.\nConclusions: Based on the evidence reviewed, provisional recommendations for appropriate tests in each domain of assessment are presented, though further validation of most tests is warranted. Review findings can support efficient and evidenced-based test-selection and guide future research in this area.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R., John, B., & Roderique-Davies, G.

    "title": "Development and Initial Validation of a Rock Climbing Craving Questionnaire (RCCQ)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nConceptual similarities have been identified between experiences of extreme sports athletes and those with drug and behavioral addictions. Evidence suggests rock climbers experience craving and other withdrawal-like states when abstinent from their sport. However, no studies have attempted to quantitatively measure the craving experienced by participants of any extreme sports. Such a measure could allow a greater understanding of the craving experienced by extreme sports athletes and a comparison of these across sports (e.g., surfing) and activities (e.g., drug-use). Therefore, using validated craving measures as a template, the aim of the two studies outlined here was to design and preliminarily validate a subjective multidimensional inventory that could be used to measure craving in the sports of rock-climbing and mountaineering (“RCCQ”). The aim of the first study was to investigate the factor structure of a preliminary measure of craving. Climbers (n = 407) completed the RCCQ. A 3-factor model explained 53.65% of the total variance in item scores. All three factors comprised five items each, which were conceptually labeled as “urge to climb” “negative reinforcement” and “positive reinforcement.” The aim of the second study was to validate the 15-item 3-factor RCCQ resulting from Study 1 using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Climbers (n = 254) completed the questionnaire under a climbing-related cue condition or a cue-neutral condition. CFA revealed a good model fit and that all individual parameter estimates were significant and standard errors were within reasonable limits once item 13 was removed from Factor 1. Study 1 supports the multi-dimensional nature of rock climbing craving and shows parallels with substance-related craving in reflecting intention and positive (desire) and negative (withdrawal) reinforcement. Study 2 confirms this factor structure and gives initial validation to the measure with evidence that these factors are sensitive to cue exposure. Given the preliminary nature of the data, any practical implications are tentative. However, if as shown here, craving for climbing (and potentially other extreme sports) is similar to that experienced by drug-users and addicts, there is the potential that climbing and other extreme sports could be used as a replacement therapy for drug users.\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nRoderique-Davies, G., Heirene, R.

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground and aims: Recent investigations have highlighted the value of neuropsychological testing for the assessment and screening of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the suitability of the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) for this purpose.\nMethods: Comparing 28 participants with ARBD (11 with Korsakoff’s Syndrome and 17 with the umbrella “ARBD” diagnosis) and 30 alcohol-dependent participants without ARBD (ALs) we calculated Area Under the Curve (AUC) statistics, sensitivity and specificity values, base-rate adjusted predictive valueblogs, and likelihood ratios for both tests.\nResults: High levels of screening accuracy were found for the total scores of both the ACE-III (AUC = .823, 95% CIs [.714, .932], SE = .056; optimal cut-off ≤86: sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 73%) and RBANS (AUC = .846, 95% CIs [.746, .947], SE = .052; optimal cut-off ≤83: sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 67%) at multiple cut-off points. Removing participants with a history of polysubstance from the samples (10 ALs and 1 ARBD) improved the diagnostic capabilities of the RBANS substantially (AUC = .915, 95% CIs [.831, .999], SE = .043; optimal cut-off ≤85: sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 80%), while only minor improvements to the ACE-III’s accuracy were observed (AUC = .854, 95% CIs [.744, .963], SE = .056; optimal cut-off ≤88: sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 75%).\nConclusions: Overall, both the ACE-III and RBANS are suitable tools for ARBD screening within an alcohol-dependent population, though the RBANS is the superior of the two. Clinicians using these tools for ARBD screening should be cautious of false-positive outcomes and should therefore combine them with other assessment methods (e.g., neuroimaging, clinical observations) and more detailed neuropsychological testing before reaching diagnostic decisions.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nBrown, P., Heirene, R.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ARNDs in South Wales, U.K., and determine the specific diagnostic terms and criteria used in clinical practice.\nMethod: A naturalistic, survey-based prevalence study was undertaken wherein data were collected retrospectively for all individuals with ARNDs attending services during all of 2015 and 2016. A diverse sample of health and social care services (N = 60) in South Wales took part in the study.\nResults: A total of 490 individuals with ARNDs were identified by participating services, equating to an age-specific rate of 34 individuals per 100,000 inhabitants. Variability was observed across age ranges and genders, with most identified in the 45-64 year age range and a male:female ratio of 2.6:1. Twenty-three individuals younger than age 35 were identified, demonstrating an increase in younger cases compared with previous studies. Various diagnostic terms were used, with “alcohol-related brain damage” being most common. Only 6.3% of cases were diagnosed according to specific criteria and 44.3% were reported as having a “probable” ARND, meaning no official diagnosis had been designated but initial assessments indicated that they likely had an ARND.\nConclusions: Findings provide a novel understanding of ARND prevalence in a previously understudied area, although the prevalence estimate is conservative and should be interpreted cautiously for reasons discussed. Findings also highlight an inconsistency between diagnoses presented in nosological systems (e.g., International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision) and those used in practice and therefore a need to evaluate novel diagnostic conceptualizations of alcohol-related neurocognitive impairment.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R.

    "text": "Abstract\nLittle is understood about the attentional mechanisms that lead to perceptions of collective efficacy. This paper presents two studies that address this lack of understanding. Study one examined participant’s (N = 59) attentional processes relating to positive, neutral, or negative emotional facial photographs, when instructed to select their “most confident” or “least confident” team. Eye gaze metrics of first fixation duration (FFD), fixation duration (FD), and fixation count (FC) were measured alongside individual perceptions of collective efficacy and emotional valence of the teams selected. Participants had shorter FFD, longer FD, and more FC on positive faces when instructed to select their most confident team (p &lt; 0.05). Collective efficacy and emotional valence were significantly greater when participants selected their most confident team (p &lt; 0.05). Study two explored the influence of video content familiarity of team-based observation interventions on attentional processes and collective efficacy in interdependent team-sport athletes (N = 34). When participants were exposed to familiar (own team/sport) and unfamiliar (unknown team/sport) team-based performance video, eye tracking data revealed similar gaze behaviors for the two conditions in terms of areas of interest. However, collective efficacy increased most for the familiar condition. Study one results indicate that the emotional expressions of team members influence both where and for how long we look at potential team members, and that conspecifics’ emotional expression impacts on our perceptions of collective efficacy. For Study two, given the apparent greater increase in collective efficacy for the familiar condition, the similar attentional processes evident for familiar and unfamiliar team footage suggests that differences in meaning of the observed content dictates collective efficacy perceptions. Across both studies, the findings indicate the importance of positive emotional vicarious experiences when using team-based observation interventions to improve collective efficacy in teams.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nShearer, D.

    "text": "Abstract\nObjective: Consumer Protection Tools (CPTs; e.g., deposit limits, timeouts) are provided by gambling sites to assist customers to gamble without harms. We aimed to understand how CPTs are used, and by which customers, which is essential to determine their effectiveness.\nMethod: We examined the account data of 39,853 customers (median age = 33 years; 84% male) across six Australian wagering sites over 1 year (2018/07/01–2019/06/30).\nResults: Most (83%) customers did not use any CPTs, with low rates of use for deposit limits (15.8%), timeouts (0.55%–1.57%), and self-exclusion tools (0.16%–0.57%) observed. Requiring customers to set a deposit limit or opt-out of setting one led to substantial increases in limit setting. Many customers who used limits later changed them, typically by increasing or removing them. Non-CPT users and deposit limit users were similar in their demographic and gambling characteristics, while comparatively, timeout and/or self-exclusion users were younger and displayed more risky gambling behaviors (e.g., higher net loss and betting frequency).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that voluntary deposit limits have inherent limitations in addressing harmful behaviors if consumers can easily increase or remove limits. The study suggests that greater efforts are needed to encourage CPT use among a broad customer base, including default limits requiring opt-out, greater restrictions on increasing or removing limits, and more persuasive communication of the benefits of timeouts.\nPublic Health Significance Statement\nThis study of nearly 40,000 online gambling customers in Australia found that most (83%) customers do not use the consumer protection tools (CPTs) available to them. The findings highlight the need for gambling sites and policy makers to implement strategies that encourage the volitional uptake of CPTs. This study identified that a key limitation of current deposit limit tools is the ability to easily increase limits multiple times or remove them altogether, which supports the introduction of greater friction and delays to increase limits and messaging to assist customers to determine, set, and adhere to appropriate limits.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R.

    "text": "Abstract\nAims: We tested the effectiveness of three different messages designed to increase limit-setting on gambling sites and sent these via e-mail or in-account notification to compare delivery modes. As a secondary aim, we examined the effects of limit-setting on gambling behaviour.\nDesign: A pre-registered, naturalistic randomized control trial using a 3 × 2 plus control design.\nSetting: Four on-line Australian sports and racing wagering websites.\nParticipants: A total of 31 989 wagering customers (reduced to 26,560 after eligibility screening) who had placed bets on at least 5 days in the past 30 [mean age = 41.4, standard deviation (SD) = 14.3; 79% male].\nInterventions and comparators: Messages were sent via e-mail or in-account notification by on-line gambling operators and were designed to either: (1) be informative, describing the availability and purpose of the tool (informative messages), (2) highlight the benefits other people receive from using the tool (social messages) or (3) promote the benefit individuals could receive from using the tool (personal messages). A control group who did not receive messages was monitored for comparison.\nMeasurements: Our primary outcome was the number of customers who set a deposit limit within 5 days of receiving messages and secondary outcomes included pre- and post-message betting behaviour (e.g. average daily wager).\nFindings: One hundred and sixty-one (0.71%) customers sent messages set limits compared to three (0.08%) controls [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 8.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.99, 33.76)]. Social and personal messages were no more effective than informative messages (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.65, 1.48; aOR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.60, 1.44) and in-account messages were no more effective than e-mails (aOR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.71, 1.49). Customers who set limits significantly decreased their average daily wager, the SD of daily wager, net loss and betting intensity compared with non-limit-setters.\nConclusions: Messages to on-line gambling website customers are inexpensive, and may lead to small but impactful increases in setting deposit limits. Limit-setting may be an effective strategy for reducing gambling expenditure and intensity.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R. M. & Gainsbury, S. M.

    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives: The ability to accurately recall past gambling behavior and outcomes is essential for making informed decisions about future gambling. We aimed to determine whether online gambling customers can accurately recall their recent gambling outcomes and betting frequency. \nMethod: An online survey was distributed to 40,000 customers of an Australian sports and race wagering website which asked participants to recall their past 30-day net outcome (i.e., total amount won or lost) and number of bets. We compared responses to these questions with participants’ actual outcomes as provided by the online site. \nResults: Among the 514 participants who reported their net outcome, only 21 (4.09%) were accurate within a 10% margin of their actual outcome. Participants were most likely to underestimate their losses (N = 333, 64.79%). Lower actual net losses were associated with greater underestimation and overestimation of losses. Of the 652 participants who reported their gambling frequency, 48 (7.36%) were accurate within a 10% margin of their actual frequency. Most participants underestimated their number of bets (N = 454, 69.63%). Higher actual betting frequencies were associated with underestimating betting and lower actual frequencies with overestimating betting. \nConclusions: The poor recall accuracy we observed suggests public health approaches to gambling harm minimization that assume people make informed decisions about their future bets based on past outcomes and available funds should be reconsidered. Findings also question the reliability of research outcomes predicated on self-reported gambling behavior. Research is needed to determine the best methods of increasing people’s awareness of their actual expenditure and outcomes.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R.

Such cases pose a challenge with regard to the assessment of mental capacity within clinical settings. Recent position articles state that the frontal lobe paradox is a well-known phenomenon within the field of neuropsychology, anecdotal reports from clinicians in the UK suggest this is not the case. Consequently, we conducted a scoping review to examine the breadth and depth of literature relating to the frontal lobe paradox. Searches were conducted using electronic databases and search engines, which were supplemented with a snowball search of the references used within relevant literature. We identified and reviewed 28 documents specifically related to the frontal lobe paradox. Nearly 50% of all identified academic texts published since 2000 were position articles that cited a handful of case studies published between 1936 and 1986 as evidence for the phenomenon. We also observed instances of articles citing position articles as evidence of the frontal lobe paradox. Overall, our findings indicate a lack of readily accessible research specific to the frontal lobe paradox. In particular, there is a lack of contemporary research specific to the subject and an absence of clarification as to which syndromes and disorders are included within the term.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nNewstead, S., Lewis, J., Roderique-Davies, G., Heirene, R.

Open science practices include study pre-registration, open data, open access, and avoiding methods that can lead to publication bias and low replication rates. Although gambling studies uses similar research methods as behavioral research fields that have struggled with replication, we know little about the uptake of open science research practices in gambling-focused research. We conducted a scoping review of 500 recent (1/1/2016–12/1/2019) studies focused on gambling and problem gambling to examine the use of open science and transparent research practices. Our results showed that a small percentage of studies used most practices: whereas 54.6% (95% CI: [50.2, 58.9]) of studies used at least one of nine open science practices, each practice’s prevalence was: 1.6% for pre-registration (95% CI: [0.8, 3.1]), 3.2% for open data (95% CI: [2.0, 5.1]), 0% for open notebook, 35.2% for open access (95% CI: [31.1, 39.5]), 7.8% for open materials (95% CI: [5.8, 10.5]), 1.4% for open code (95% CI: [0.7, 2.9]), and 15.0% for preprint posting (95% CI: [12.1, 18.4]). In all, 6.4% (95% CI: [4.6, 8.9]) of the studies included a power analysis and 2.4% (95% CI: [1.4, 4.2]) were replication studies.

    "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nAlcohol‐related brain damage (ARBD) is an umbrella term referring to the neurocognitive impairments caused by excessive and prolonged alcohol use and the associated nutritional deficiencies. This study evaluated the outcomes of an online research‐informed training program for ARBD which aimed to improve client outcomes by promoting support staff’s awareness and confidence in working with clients who may have (or who are at risk of developing) the condition.\nMethods\nStaff working within a large non‐governmental non‐profit housing organisation (n = 883) enrolled in the training program. Questionnaires were used pre‐ and post‐training to collect self‐reported awareness of ARBD and confidence in supporting individuals with the condition. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 27 staff members approximately 10 weeks post‐completion of the program. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed by employing qualitative content analysis.\nResults\nFindings from the questionnaires indicated a significant increase in all measures after completing the training program. Three main themes were developed based on the interview data: changes to awareness and understanding; professional practice; and training‐specific characteristics. Participants reported changes in their ability to identify potential service users with ARBD and confidence in doing so.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nOur findings demonstrate that online training programs can be effective in improving support staff’s ability to identify ARBD, potentially leading an increase in signposting service users to relevant services. The research‐informed nature of the training demonstrates that translating research findings directly to frontline workers can have a substantial impact and may improve outcomes for this client group.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nWard, R., Roderique-Davies, G., Hughes, H., Heirene, R.

In this opinion piece, we describe and evaluate the current state of open science practices in behavioral addiction research. We highlight the specific value of open science practices for the field; discuss recent field-specific meta-scientific reviews that show the adoption of such practices remains in its infancy; address the challenges to engaging with open science; and make recommendations for how researchers, journals, and scientific institutions can work to overcome these challenges and promote high-quality, transparently reported behavioral addiction research. By collaboratively promoting open science practices, the field can create a more sustainable and productive research environment that benefits both the scientific community and society as a whole.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nEben, C., Bőthe, B., Brevers, D., Clark, L., Grubbs, J.

As more researchers adopt preregistration as a regular research practice, examining the nature and content of preregistrations can help identify strengths and weaknesses of current practices. The value of preregistration, in part, relates to the specificity of the study plan and the extent to which investigators adhere to this plan. We identified 53 preregistrations from the gambling studies field meeting our predefined eligibility criteria and scored their level of specificity using a 23-item protocol developed to measure the extent to which a clear and exhaustive preregistration plan restricts various researcher degrees of freedom (RDoF; i.e., the many methodological choices available to researchers when collecting and analysing data, and when reporting their findings). We also scored studies on a 32-item protocol that measured adherence to the preregistered plan in the study manuscript. We found that gambling preregistrations had low specificity levels on most RDoF. However, a comparison with a sample of cross-disciplinary preregistrations (N = 52; Bakker et al., 2020) indicated that gambling preregistrations scored higher on 12 (of 29) items. Thirteen (65%) of the 20 associated published articles or preprints deviated from the protocol without declaring as much (the mean number of undeclared deviations per article was 2.25, SD = 2.34). Overall, while we found improvements in specificity and adherence over time (2017-2020), our findings suggest the purported benefits of preregistration—including increasing transparency and reducing RDoF—are not fully achieved by current practices. Using our findings, we provide 10 practical recommendations that can be used to support and refine preregistration practices.\nNote: This study is under review at Meta-Psychology and is due to be published soon, pending a successful reproducibility check.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess the pre-printed article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R., LaPlante, D., Louderback, E.
