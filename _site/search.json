    "section": "",
    "text": "Planning ahead\nI (hopefully) have a long career ahead of me in addiction research, and I don’t want it to be guided solely by the tide of publishing pressure. I want to do research that adds real value to the world.\nWith this in mind, I’m thinking about problem gambling prevention a lot at the moment and where to place my focus. To help with this, I’ve started mapping all the existing harm prevention strategies used in practice or proposed in the gambling literature.\n\n\nPrevention strategies visualised\nTo make this process a little more interesting for me and anyone who reads this, I’ve been playing around with the plotly R package to present my catalogue of prevention strategies in a visual and interactive way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork in progress\n\n\n\nPlease note that I’ve only just started making the interactive chart and I’m conscious that it currently provides a very incomplete picture of the strategies available. I will be reading around and adding more strategies and information over the next few months (starting July 2023).\nThat said, please feel free to suggest some strategies or edits using the comments section at the end (or you can send me an email).\n\n\nBelow is what I have so far, visualised as a sunburst chart. Hover over each category or strategy to reveal descriptions of each, and click on the bars to see more. It’s best viewed on a PC/mac or tablet, not on mobile (if you are on mobile, turn it to landscape mode).\n\n\nShow set-up code\n# Install and load the groundhog package to ensure consistency of the package versions used here:\n# install.packages(\"groundhog\") # Install\n\nlibrary(groundhog) # Load\n\n# List desired packages:\npackages &lt;- c('tidyverse', # Clean, organise, and visualise data\n              'plotly', # Add interactive elements to figures\n              'sysfonts', # Special fonts for figures\n              'showtext', # Special fonts for figures\n              'htmlwidgets') # Make plotly plots HTML format for rendering in Quarto\n              \n\n# Load desired package with versions specific to project start date:\ngroundhog.library(packages, \"2023-06-05\") # Set Slightly earlier than start date as some of the plotly dependency packages wouldn't load properly with date as 07/07/2023\n\n# Load new font for figures/graphs\nfont_add_google(\"Poppins\")\nshowtext_auto()\n\n\n\n\nShow code used to create chart\n# Load manually input data:\ngam_prevention_data&lt;- read.csv(\"gamb_prevention_data.csv\") %&gt;% select(Layer:Description) # Warning, something as simple as an apostrophe and this dataset can cause it to not play nice\n\n# gam_prevention_data&lt;- read.csv(\"posts/2023-gambling-harms-chart/gamb_prevention_data.csv\") %&gt;% select(Layer:Description)\n\n# Make sunburst chart:\ngam_prevention_sunburst&lt;- plot_ly(gam_prevention_data,\n                                   ids = ~IDs,\n                                   labels = ~Label,\n                                   parents = ~Parents,\n                                   hoverinfo = \"text\",  # Needed for below argument to work\n                                   hovertext = ~Description,\n                                   type = 'sunburst',\n                                   maxdepth = 3,\n                                   insidetextorientation = 'radial',\n                                   marker = list(line = list(width = 5, color = '#002B36')),  # Adjust border size + color\n                                   sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n   plotly::layout(colorway = c(\"#289998\", \"#288D98\", \"#287699\", \"#7E6F98\", \"#BFB3C0\", \"#FFF7E7\", \"#E6C97F\", \"#8C8033\", \"#7E9F6E\", \"#65BBA3\", \"#94C8C0\", \"#998F28\", \"#62A899\", \"#986289\", \"#289970\"),\n         font = list(\n           # family = \"Poppins\", # I can't get this to work so let me know if you can!\n                     color = \"#FFF7E7\"), # Set main font so the central layer text can be seen\n         paper_bgcolor = '#002B36', # background consistent with site\n         plot_bgcolor = '#002B36',\n        hoverlabel = list(font = list(size = 12)))  # Increase the font size for hover text)\n\n# Save plot as a HTML file (it doesn't render well with quarto otherwise):\nsaveWidget(gam_prevention_sunburst, 'fig.html')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreating the chart\n\n\n\nI’ve included the R code used to create the chart in the drop-down sections just above it. Feel free to recreate it (the data are on the Github repo for this site) or adapt the code to your own chart, but please credit me if you do :)\n\n\n\n\nThe evidence\nAs I (re-)read the literature on this topic, I’m also creating a record of relevant studies and resources relating to each prevention strategy. This section is even less developed than the chart, so the same call for suggestions applies.\nThere will eventually be a lot of information presented here, so I’ve hidden the text for each prevention strategy inside expandable boxes for easier navigation.\n\nConsumer protection tools\n\n\nRestrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal loss limits\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA survey (n = 2352) of Norsk Tipping (a Norwegian Government-owned gambling operator) customers’ perspectives on the recently implemented global loss limit of NOK 20,000 per month (~$2450USD; Auer et al., 2018). It’s slightly unclear, but it appears that players also had to set a daily and monthly loss limit specific to game types (e.g., online casino, bingo), but the all-game global limit of 20k NOK per month still applied. Most found the new limits easy to understand (76%) and had positive attitudes towards them (79%). Only 25% agreed entirely or in part that a maximum loss limit was relevant to the, and 6% of green players (i.e., low risk of problem gambling) and 16% of red players (i.e., high risk of problem gambling) said they continued to gamble with other companies after reaching their limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal stake limits\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis UK Gambling Commission report from 2020 discusses consumer perspectives on stake limits (n = 32, weekly gamblers). Low-risk participants (i.e., PGSI score 0-2) were in favour of stake limits, but wary of losing the fun of gambling and preferred to limit stakes on non-skill games. There was more disagreement within moderate risk participants (i.e., PGSI score 3-7), but they mostly agreed with the idea of stake limits, arguing that multiple variables need to be considered when determining the limit amount (e.g., household income & state of mind) and that players should be able to overrule limits. High risk gamblers (i.e., PGSI score ≥8) were positive about stake limits believed the responsibility to protect players layed firmly on the shoulders of betting firms. Overall, participants were more positive about loss limits than stake limits.\nIt seems that a lot of online gambling sites indirectly impose stake limits by having maximum payout amounts (e.g., £100,000). Payout limits vary from site to site and across activities, but these operator-protecting restrictions (which are sometimes reduced for big winners…) can limit customer stakes.

Low-risk participants (i.e., PGSI score 0-2) were likely to say that safer gambling messaging was effective, but saw it as not relevant for them and therefore they opted out of such messaging. Moderate risk gamblers (i.e., PGSI score 3-7) opted out of messaging also as they didn’t feel it was for them and didn’t like to be reminded to “gamble responsibly” because they felt in control of their gambling. High risk gamblers (i.e., PGSI score ≥8) stated that highlighting losses could push people to spend more money and that such communications may need to be replaced by limits to be effective. In general, safer gambling messages were viewed as being easy to opt out of and easy to ignore, warranting actual barriers to risky play (i.e., limits).\nThis 2022 study including 3 pre-registered randomized exmperiments (n ≈ 500 per study) found no evidence for a protective effect (on spending behaviour) of the “When the fun stops, stop” warning message commonly used by UK gambling companies. Participants were UK adults who had previously gambled. They were given a monetary endowment with which they were allowed to bet on either an online roulette game (Study 2) or real soccer events (Study 1 & 3). The presence and presentation of the warning message varied between participants in each study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk assessment\n\n\nPublic health campaigns\n\n\nBlocking tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank gambling blocks\n\n\n\n\n\nThis 2023 report from GamCare summarises the outcomes and recommendations from a virtual workshop on bank gambling block involving researchers, representatives from the financial and gambling industries, gambling support services, debt and money advice services, and individuals with lived experience. They make a number of recommendations for how banks can improve their blocking tools not discussed here. Key findings:\n\nMany UK banks now offer gambling blocks, but awareness of these tools is low.\nThe ease of accessing and using the blocks varies across banks.\nMost banks allow the customers to self deactivate the blocks using their mobile app, although there is to be gay 48 or 72 hour cooling off period before this takes effect. Some banks require customers to speak to their customer support team before turning off the block, increasing friction.\nThere are many loopholes which allow customers with a bank gambling block to continue gambling (e.g., e-wallets; overseas gambling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct design\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeposit limit anchors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis 2021 report by the UK Behavioural Insights Team involved a trial of different deposit limit anchors (i.e., potential limit values presented in a dropdown menu to consumers when first setting their limit) with three arms: [1] a business as usual condition (with anchors ranging from £5 to £100,000), [2] anchors only as high as £250, and [3] a free text box to enter a desired limit with no visible anchors. Existing bet 365 customers about deposit limits were randomly selected to be sent prompts encouraging them to set limits between January–April 2020. 1,731 participants split roughly evenly across the 3 arms set limits. Customers in the control (arm 1) group set the highest limits (Mdn = £14.3, M = £1601), followed by those in the reduced anchor group (arm 2; Mdn = £8.3, M = £230.8), and the free-text box group (arm 3; Mdn = £7.1, M = £308.78). Customers in the 2nd and 3rd arm were slightly more likely to remove their limit in the trial period, but the difference was not statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{heirene2023,\n  author = {Heirene, Rob},\n  title = {How Can We Prevent Gambling Harms?},\n  date = {2023-07-07},\n  url = {https://robheirene.netlify.app/posts/2023-gambling-harms-chart},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHeirene, Rob. 2023. “How Can We Prevent Gambling Harms? .”\nJuly 7, 2023. https://robheirene.netlify.app/posts/2023-gambling-harms-chart."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground and aims: Extreme sports athletes are often labeled “adrenaline junkies” by the media, implying they are addicted to their sport. Research suggests during abstinence these athletes may experience withdrawal states characteristic of individuals with an addiction (Celsi, Rose, & Leigh, 1993; Franken, Zijlstra, & Muris, 2006; Willig, 2008). Despite this notion, no research has directly explored withdrawal experiences of extreme sports athletes.\nMethods: Using semi-structured interviews, we explored withdrawal experiences of high (n = 4) and average-ability (n = 4) male rock climbers during periods of abstinence. We investigated the psychological and behavioral aspects of withdrawal, including craving, anhedonia, and negative affect; and differences in the frequency and intensity of these states between groups.\nResults: Deductive content analysis indicated support for each of the three categories of anhedonia, craving, and negative affect. Consistent with existing substance addiction literature, high-ability climbers recalled more frequent and intense craving states and negative affect during abstinence compared with average-ability climbers. No differences in anhedonic symptoms between high and average-ability participants were found.\nConclusions: Rock climbing athletes appear to experience withdrawal symptoms when abstinent from their sport comparable to individuals with substance and behavioral addictions. The implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R.

A number of studies have evaluated the applicability of various neuropsychological tests within the context of ARBD assessment, yet little attempt has been made to collate this evidence and discuss its clinical application. The aim of this protocol is to outline the methodology for a systematic review that aims to identify the neuropsychological tools being used to assess cognitive impairments in individuals with ARBD and evaluate their efficacy within this context. We will search a number of online databases and other sources to identify studies using a neuropsychological tool in the screening, diagnosis or neuropsychological assessment of individuals with ARBD. Primary outcome measures of interest will be construct validity, convergent validity, reliability (retest and inter-rater), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and practical considerations. Results from the review will assist clinicians and researchers involved in the assessment and diagnosis of ARBD by providing a synthesis and critical analysis of the evidence base for each tool, allowing them to make efficient and well-informed test selections. Review findings could also be used to inform the development of guidelines for ARBD diagnosis and assessment.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R., Roderique-Davies, G., Roberts, P. & John, B.

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Neuropsychological assessment is central to identifying and determining the extent of Alcohol-Related Cognitive Impairment (ARCI). The present systematic review aimed to synthesize and discuss the evidence appraising the neuropsychological tests used to assess ARCI in order to support clinicians and researchers in selecting appropriate tests for use with this population.\nMethods: We searched for studies investigating the psychometric, diagnostic and practical values of tools used in the screening, diagnosis, and assessment of Korsakoff’s Syndrome (KS), Alcohol-Related Dementia (ARD), and those with a specific diagnosis of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). The following databases were searched in March 2016 and again in August 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psych-INFO, ProQuest Psychology, and Science Direct. Study quality was assessed using a checklist designed by the authors to evaluate the specific factors contributing to robust and clearly reported studies in this area. A total of 43 studies were included following the screening of 3646 studies by title and abstract and 360 at full-text. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity in the tests and ARCI samples investigated in the studies reviewed. Instead, review findings were narratively synthesized and divided according to five domains of assessment: cognitive screening, memory, executive function, intelligence and test batteries, and premorbid ability. Effect sizes (d) were calculated to supplement findings.\nResults: Overall, several measures demonstrated sensitivity to the cognitive deficits associated with chronic alcoholism and an ability to differentiate between gradations of impairment. However, findings relating to the other psychometric qualities of the tests, including those important for the accurate assessment and monitoring of ARCI (e.g., test-retest reliability), were entirely absent or limited. Additionally, the synthesis of neuropsychological outcomes presented here supports the recent impetus for a move away from discrete diagnoses (e.g., KS, ARD) and the distinctions between them toward more broad and inclusive diagnostic conceptualizations of ARCI, thereby recognizing the heterogeneity in presentation.\nConclusions: Based on the evidence reviewed, provisional recommendations for appropriate tests in each domain of assessment are presented, though further validation of most tests is warranted. Review findings can support efficient and evidenced-based test-selection and guide future research in this area.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R., John, B., & Roderique-Davies, G.

    "title": "Development and Initial Validation of a Rock Climbing Craving Questionnaire (RCCQ)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nConceptual similarities have been identified between experiences of extreme sports athletes and those with drug and behavioral addictions. Evidence suggests rock climbers experience craving and other withdrawal-like states when abstinent from their sport. However, no studies have attempted to quantitatively measure the craving experienced by participants of any extreme sports. Such a measure could allow a greater understanding of the craving experienced by extreme sports athletes and a comparison of these across sports (e.g., surfing) and activities (e.g., drug-use). Therefore, using validated craving measures as a template, the aim of the two studies outlined here was to design and preliminarily validate a subjective multidimensional inventory that could be used to measure craving in the sports of rock-climbing and mountaineering (“RCCQ”). The aim of the first study was to investigate the factor structure of a preliminary measure of craving. Climbers (n = 407) completed the RCCQ. A 3-factor model explained 53.65% of the total variance in item scores. All three factors comprised five items each, which were conceptually labeled as “urge to climb” “negative reinforcement” and “positive reinforcement.” The aim of the second study was to validate the 15-item 3-factor RCCQ resulting from Study 1 using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Climbers (n = 254) completed the questionnaire under a climbing-related cue condition or a cue-neutral condition. CFA revealed a good model fit and that all individual parameter estimates were significant and standard errors were within reasonable limits once item 13 was removed from Factor 1. Study 1 supports the multi-dimensional nature of rock climbing craving and shows parallels with substance-related craving in reflecting intention and positive (desire) and negative (withdrawal) reinforcement. Study 2 confirms this factor structure and gives initial validation to the measure with evidence that these factors are sensitive to cue exposure. Given the preliminary nature of the data, any practical implications are tentative. However, if as shown here, craving for climbing (and potentially other extreme sports) is similar to that experienced by drug-users and addicts, there is the potential that climbing and other extreme sports could be used as a replacement therapy for drug users.\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nRoderique-Davies, G., Heirene, R.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground and aims: Recent investigations have highlighted the value of neuropsychological testing for the assessment and screening of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the suitability of the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) for this purpose.\nMethods: Comparing 28 participants with ARBD (11 with Korsakoff’s Syndrome and 17 with the umbrella “ARBD” diagnosis) and 30 alcohol-dependent participants without ARBD (ALs) we calculated Area Under the Curve (AUC) statistics, sensitivity and specificity values, base-rate adjusted predictive valueblogs, and likelihood ratios for both tests.\nResults: High levels of screening accuracy were found for the total scores of both the ACE-III (AUC = .823, 95% CIs [.714, .932], SE = .056; optimal cut-off ≤86: sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 73%) and RBANS (AUC = .846, 95% CIs [.746, .947], SE = .052; optimal cut-off ≤83: sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 67%) at multiple cut-off points. Removing participants with a history of polysubstance from the samples (10 ALs and 1 ARBD) improved the diagnostic capabilities of the RBANS substantially (AUC = .915, 95% CIs [.831, .999], SE = .043; optimal cut-off ≤85: sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 80%), while only minor improvements to the ACE-III’s accuracy were observed (AUC = .854, 95% CIs [.744, .963], SE = .056; optimal cut-off ≤88: sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 75%).\nConclusions: Overall, both the ACE-III and RBANS are suitable tools for ARBD screening within an alcohol-dependent population, though the RBANS is the superior of the two. Clinicians using these tools for ARBD screening should be cautious of false-positive outcomes and should therefore combine them with other assessment methods (e.g., neuroimaging, clinical observations) and more detailed neuropsychological testing before reaching diagnostic decisions.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nBrown, P., Heirene, R.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ARNDs in South Wales, U.K., and determine the specific diagnostic terms and criteria used in clinical practice.\nMethod: A naturalistic, survey-based prevalence study was undertaken wherein data were collected retrospectively for all individuals with ARNDs attending services during all of 2015 and 2016. A diverse sample of health and social care services (N = 60) in South Wales took part in the study.\nResults: A total of 490 individuals with ARNDs were identified by participating services, equating to an age-specific rate of 34 individuals per 100,000 inhabitants. Variability was observed across age ranges and genders, with most identified in the 45-64 year age range and a male:female ratio of 2.6:1. Twenty-three individuals younger than age 35 were identified, demonstrating an increase in younger cases compared with previous studies. Various diagnostic terms were used, with “alcohol-related brain damage” being most common. Only 6.3% of cases were diagnosed according to specific criteria and 44.3% were reported as having a “probable” ARND, meaning no official diagnosis had been designated but initial assessments indicated that they likely had an ARND.\nConclusions: Findings provide a novel understanding of ARND prevalence in a previously understudied area, although the prevalence estimate is conservative and should be interpreted cautiously for reasons discussed. Findings also highlight an inconsistency between diagnoses presented in nosological systems (e.g., International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision) and those used in practice and therefore a need to evaluate novel diagnostic conceptualizations of alcohol-related neurocognitive impairment.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R.

    "text": "Abstract\nLittle is understood about the attentional mechanisms that lead to perceptions of collective efficacy. This paper presents two studies that address this lack of understanding. Study one examined participant’s (N = 59) attentional processes relating to positive, neutral, or negative emotional facial photographs, when instructed to select their “most confident” or “least confident” team. Eye gaze metrics of first fixation duration (FFD), fixation duration (FD), and fixation count (FC) were measured alongside individual perceptions of collective efficacy and emotional valence of the teams selected. Participants had shorter FFD, longer FD, and more FC on positive faces when instructed to select their most confident team (p &lt; 0.05). Collective efficacy and emotional valence were significantly greater when participants selected their most confident team (p &lt; 0.05). Study two explored the influence of video content familiarity of team-based observation interventions on attentional processes and collective efficacy in interdependent team-sport athletes (N = 34). When participants were exposed to familiar (own team/sport) and unfamiliar (unknown team/sport) team-based performance video, eye tracking data revealed similar gaze behaviors for the two conditions in terms of areas of interest. However, collective efficacy increased most for the familiar condition. Study one results indicate that the emotional expressions of team members influence both where and for how long we look at potential team members, and that conspecifics’ emotional expression impacts on our perceptions of collective efficacy. For Study two, given the apparent greater increase in collective efficacy for the familiar condition, the similar attentional processes evident for familiar and unfamiliar team footage suggests that differences in meaning of the observed content dictates collective efficacy perceptions. Across both studies, the findings indicate the importance of positive emotional vicarious experiences when using team-based observation interventions to improve collective efficacy in teams.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nShearer, D.

This call should be extended to the entire field of addiction research: there is a need to focus on ensuring that the understanding of addiction and related phenomena gained through the extant literature is robust and replicable. This article discusses two important questions addictions researchers should consider before proceeding with replication studies: [1] which studies should we attempt to replicate? And: [2] how should we interpret the findings of a replication study in relation to the original study?

    "text": "Abstract\nObjective: Consumer Protection Tools (CPTs; e.g., deposit limits, timeouts) are provided by gambling sites to assist customers to gamble without harms. We aimed to understand how CPTs are used, and by which customers, which is essential to determine their effectiveness.\nMethod: We examined the account data of 39,853 customers (median age = 33 years; 84% male) across six Australian wagering sites over 1 year (2018/07/01–2019/06/30).\nResults: Most (83%) customers did not use any CPTs, with low rates of use for deposit limits (15.8%), timeouts (0.55%–1.57%), and self-exclusion tools (0.16%–0.57%) observed. Requiring customers to set a deposit limit or opt-out of setting one led to substantial increases in limit setting. Many customers who used limits later changed them, typically by increasing or removing them. Non-CPT users and deposit limit users were similar in their demographic and gambling characteristics, while comparatively, timeout and/or self-exclusion users were younger and displayed more risky gambling behaviors (e.g., higher net loss and betting frequency).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that voluntary deposit limits have inherent limitations in addressing harmful behaviors if consumers can easily increase or remove limits. The study suggests that greater efforts are needed to encourage CPT use among a broad customer base, including default limits requiring opt-out, greater restrictions on increasing or removing limits, and more persuasive communication of the benefits of timeouts.\nPublic Health Significance Statement\nThis study of nearly 40,000 online gambling customers in Australia found that most (83%) customers do not use the consumer protection tools (CPTs) available to them. The findings highlight the need for gambling sites and policy makers to implement strategies that encourage the volitional uptake of CPTs. This study identified that a key limitation of current deposit limit tools is the ability to easily increase limits multiple times or remove them altogether, which supports the introduction of greater friction and delays to increase limits and messaging to assist customers to determine, set, and adhere to appropriate limits.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nHeirene, R.

As a secondary aim, we examined the effects of limit-setting on gambling behaviour.\nDesign: A pre-registered, naturalistic randomized control trial using a 3 × 2 plus control design.\nSetting: Four on-line Australian sports and racing wagering websites.\nParticipants: A total of 31 989 wagering customers (reduced to 26,560 after eligibility screening) who had placed bets on at least 5 days in the past 30 [mean age = 41.4, standard deviation (SD) = 14.3; 79% male].\nInterventions and comparators: Messages were sent via e-mail or in-account notification by on-line gambling operators and were designed to either: (1) be informative, describing the availability and purpose of the tool (informative messages), (2) highlight the benefits other people receive from using the tool (social messages) or (3) promote the benefit individuals could receive from using the tool (personal messages). A control group who did not receive messages was monitored for comparison.\nMeasurements: Our primary outcome was the number of customers who set a deposit limit within 5 days of receiving messages and secondary outcomes included pre- and post-message betting behaviour (e.g. average daily wager).\nFindings: One hundred and sixty-one (0.71%) customers sent messages set limits compared to three (0.08%) controls [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 8.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.99, 33.76)]. Social and personal messages were no more effective than informative messages (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.65, 1.48; aOR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.60, 1.44) and in-account messages were no more effective than e-mails (aOR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.71, 1.49). Customers who set limits significantly decreased their average daily wager, the SD of daily wager, net loss and betting intensity compared with non-limit-setters.\nConclusions: Messages to on-line gambling website customers are inexpensive, and may lead to small but impactful increases in setting deposit limits.

We aimed to determine whether online gambling customers can accurately recall their recent gambling outcomes and betting frequency. \nMethod: An online survey was distributed to 40,000 customers of an Australian sports and race wagering website which asked participants to recall their past 30-day net outcome (i.e., total amount won or lost) and number of bets. We compared responses to these questions with participants’ actual outcomes as provided by the online site. \nResults: Among the 514 participants who reported their net outcome, only 21 (4.09%) were accurate within a 10% margin of their actual outcome. Participants were most likely to underestimate their losses (N = 333, 64.79%). Lower actual net losses were associated with greater underestimation and overestimation of losses. Of the 652 participants who reported their gambling frequency, 48 (7.36%) were accurate within a 10% margin of their actual frequency. Most participants underestimated their number of bets (N = 454, 69.63%). Higher actual betting frequencies were associated with underestimating betting and lower actual frequencies with overestimating betting. \nConclusions: The poor recall accuracy we observed suggests public health approaches to gambling harm minimization that assume people make informed decisions about their future bets based on past outcomes and available funds should be reconsidered.

Such cases pose a challenge with regard to the assessment of mental capacity within clinical settings. Recent position articles state that the frontal lobe paradox is a well-known phenomenon within the field of neuropsychology, anecdotal reports from clinicians in the UK suggest this is not the case. Consequently, we conducted a scoping review to examine the breadth and depth of literature relating to the frontal lobe paradox. Searches were conducted using electronic databases and search engines, which were supplemented with a snowball search of the references used within relevant literature. We identified and reviewed 28 documents specifically related to the frontal lobe paradox. Nearly 50% of all identified academic texts published since 2000 were position articles that cited a handful of case studies published between 1936 and 1986 as evidence for the phenomenon. We also observed instances of articles citing position articles as evidence of the frontal lobe paradox. Overall, our findings indicate a lack of readily accessible research specific to the frontal lobe paradox.

We conducted a scoping review of 500 recent (1/1/2016–12/1/2019) studies focused on gambling and problem gambling to examine the use of open science and transparent research practices. Our results showed that a small percentage of studies used most practices: whereas 54.6% (95% CI: [50.2, 58.9]) of studies used at least one of nine open science practices, each practice’s prevalence was: 1.6% for pre-registration (95% CI: [0.8, 3.1]), 3.2% for open data (95% CI: [2.0, 5.1]), 0% for open notebook, 35.2% for open access (95% CI: [31.1, 39.5]), 7.8% for open materials (95% CI: [5.8, 10.5]), 1.4% for open code (95% CI: [0.7, 2.9]), and 15.0% for preprint posting (95% CI: [12.1, 18.4]).

This study evaluated the outcomes of an online research‐informed training program for ARBD which aimed to improve client outcomes by promoting support staff’s awareness and confidence in working with clients who may have (or who are at risk of developing) the condition.\nMethods\nStaff working within a large non‐governmental non‐profit housing organisation (n = 883) enrolled in the training program. Questionnaires were used pre‐ and post‐training to collect self‐reported awareness of ARBD and confidence in supporting individuals with the condition. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 27 staff members approximately 10 weeks post‐completion of the program. Interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed by employing qualitative content analysis.\nResults\nFindings from the questionnaires indicated a significant increase in all measures after completing the training program. Three main themes were developed based on the interview data: changes to awareness and understanding; professional practice; and training‐specific characteristics. Participants reported changes in their ability to identify potential service users with ARBD and confidence in doing so.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nOur findings demonstrate that online training programs can be effective in improving support staff’s ability to identify ARBD, potentially leading an increase in signposting service users to relevant services. The research‐informed nature of the training demonstrates that translating research findings directly to frontline workers can have a substantial impact and may improve outcomes for this client group.\n\nFull text\n\nAccess a pdf copy of the article here\n\nAPA citation\n\nWard, R., Roderique-Davies, G., Hughes, H., Heirene, R.

    "text": "Note: This study is due to be published in Meta Psychology in 2023, pending a reproducibility check.\nAbstract\nStudy preregistration is one of several “open science” practices (e.g., open data, preprints) that researchers use to improve the transparency and rigour of their research. As more researchers adopt preregistration as a regular research practice, examining the nature and content of preregistrations can help identify strengths and weaknesses of current practices. The value of preregistration, in part, relates to the specificity of the study plan and the extent to which investigators adhere to this plan. We identified 53 preregistrations from the gambling studies field meeting our predefined eligibility criteria and scored their level of specificity using a 23-item protocol developed to measure the extent to which a clear and exhaustive preregistration plan restricts various researcher degrees of freedom (RDoF; i.e., the many methodological choices available to researchers when collecting and analysing data, and when reporting their findings). We also scored studies on a 32-item protocol that measured adherence to the preregistered plan in the study manuscript. We found that gambling preregistrations had low specificity levels on most RDoF. However, a comparison with a sample of cross-disciplinary preregistrations (N = 52; Bakker et al., 2020) indicated that gambling preregistrations scored higher on 12 (of 29) items. Thirteen (65%) of the 20 associated published articles or preprints deviated from the protocol without declaring as much (the mean number of undeclared deviations per article was 2.25, SD = 2.34). Overall, while we found improvements in specificity and adherence over time (2017-2020), our findings suggest the purported benefits of preregistration—including increasing transparency and reducing RDoF—are not fully achieved by current practices.
