## Latest research findings

[The state of the open science in the behavioural addictions field]{style="color: #289998; font-weight: bold;"}

I recently contributed to a conceptual paper discussing the landscape of open science in behavioural addictions research---find out more [here](https://robheirene.netlify.app/publication/2023-open-science-landscape-eben-heirene/). The paper was led by [Dr Charlotte Eben](https://twitter.com/CharlotteEben), who is doing some great work in this space!

## What I'm working on

[Pondering + plotting]{style="color: #289998; font-weight: bold;"}

I'm currently thinking about how to progress gambling harm prevention in my research and enjoying learning how to make interactive charts using the `plotly` R package. I'm marrying these interests by making the below chart of prevention strategies for problem gambling.

It's very much a work in progress (*I still need to add many strategies and labels for those I have*), but you can find out more about my plans for this [here](https://robheirene.netlify.app/posts/2023-gambling-harms-chart).
