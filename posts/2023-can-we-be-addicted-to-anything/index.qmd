### Aim & Structure

Today we're going to talk about behavioural addictions and take a high-level look at the research that's been done in this field. We'll hopefully achieve the following this session:

-   Part 1: We'll briefly chat about behavioural addictions as a group then you'll read the introductory text below.

-   Part 2: We'll look at some outcomes from one of my ongoing review studies and discuss these as a group.

-   Part 3: In groups of at least 2, you'll pick one of the addictions discussed in Part 2 and find some research on it. The goal of this activity is to find evidence that supports the view that people can indeed be addicted to the particular behaviour in question (e.g., gambling, gaming etc). What evidence do you find? Do you think that

## Part 1

The phrase "behavioural addiction" starts to appear in academic articles in the late 80s and early 90s. Soon after, Jaffe (1990) made the argument that "addiction" was was being used too liberally---it was being applied to too many non-drug-related behaviours and we were at risk of "*trivializing dependence*".

As we'll see, these concerns didn't do much to stem the expansion of addiction's definition. Since the 1990s the net of addiction has been cast wider and wider, capturing more and more repetitive and/or compulsive behaviour patterns.

Fears that the term will lose all meaning remain heightened in academic and medical circles. And for good reason --- individuals who experience addictions to opioid-based drugs or alcohol can suffer serious, life-threatening harm and truly awful withdrawal episodes. Assigning the same label to describe their experience and someone who has a largely inconsequential difficulty controlling their spending or screen use could indeed trivialise the former's condition.

Such concerns are not unique to addiction. "Psychiatrization" and "concept creep" have been used to describe the seemingly ever-widening definitions mental health disorders, abuse, and trauma, as well as the "medicalisation" of these in the form of over-diagnosis and treatment (Haslam, 2016; Haslam et al., 2021).

**But how many behaviours really are being labelled as "addictions" in the peer-reviewed literature? And how many studies are there on these "new" addictions?**

These are some of the questions we will look at below in our part 2.

## Part 2

### Data gathering

For this study, I tried to find every peer-reviewed paper that has ever discussed a behaviour (e.g., gaming, social media use etc.) as a form of addiction. Well, every paper published on the PubMed database. I used some code to find and extract the articles, but that's not important for this seminar.

Let's try another approach to visualising this data (this plot really doesn't play well with mobile, so it's best viewed on a PC/tablet):

```{r warning=FALSE,  message=FALSE}
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Code: Dumbbell plot (publications by addiction)"
#| fig-height: 8.5

# Arrange data:
dumbbell_plot_data<- data %>%
  # filter(Year != "2023") %>%
  filter(Label != "behavioural_addictions") %>%
  group_by(Label) %>% 
  summarise(
    min = min(Year), # identify first year
    max = max(Year), # identify last  year
    min_papers = sum(Year == min(Year)),  # Count papers for first year
    max_papers = sum(Year == max(Year))   # Count papers for last year
  ) %>% 
  arrange(min) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(min, max),
    names_to = "Range",
    values_to = "Year"
  ) %>%
  # Compute a single column that contains our n papers for the first and last pub years:
  mutate(papers_this_year = case_when(Range == "max" ~ max_papers, 
                                      Range == "min" ~ min_papers)) %>%
  select(-min_papers,
         -max_papers) %>% 
  # Add a value that tells us whether a date is min or max for colouring later:
    # Tidy the behavioural addiction labels:
    mutate(Label = str_replace_all(Label, "_", " ") %>%
                 str_to_title())

# Order the behavioural addictions based on the first year of publication
label_order <- dumbbell_plot_data %>% 
  filter(Range == "min") %>% 
  arrange(Year) %>% 
  pull(Label)

# Fix the order:
dumbbell_plot_data$Label <- factor(dumbbell_plot_data$Label, levels = rev(label_order))

# Create data for every publication year per label
every_year_data <- data %>%
  filter(Label != "behavioural_addictions") %>%
  group_by(Label, Year) %>%
  summarise(n_papers = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Label = str_replace_all(Label, "_", " ") %>%
                 str_to_title())

  # Plot:

  geom_point(data = every_year_data, aes(x = Year, y = Label, size=sqrt(n_papers), text = paste(Label, "\nYear:", Year, "\nNo. of publications:", n_papers)), color="grey", alpha=0.3) +

  scale_size_continuous(guide="none") +

# print(dumbbell_plot_first_last)

# We're going to turn this into an interactive plot now using ggplotly, but this removes some of our existing theme settings, especially the fonts. The standard way of changing the font in ggplotly doesn't seem to work for me, and it seems like other people having the same issue. I found this workaround online (https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/issues/2117) which I now use below to load and use the correct font once this becomes a ggplotly:

# Get the URL for the "Reem Kufi" font from Google Fonts:
reem_kufi_file <- showtextdb::google_fonts("Reem Kufi")$regular_url 

# Create custom CSS:
reem_kufi_css <- paste0(
  "<style type = 'text/css'>",
    "@font-face { ",
      "font-family: 'Reem Kufi'; ", 
      "src: url('", reem_kufi_file, "'); ",
    "}",
  "</style>"
)

# Convert static plot to ggplotly format and adjust theme settings where required: 
dumbbell_plot_first_last_ggplotly <- ggplotly(dumbbell_plot_first_last,
                                              tooltip = 'text') %>% 
  hide_legend() %>%
  plotly::layout(margin = list(t = 90), # Increase top margin
                 font = list(family = "Reem Kufi"),
                 title = list(x = 0, y = 0.945),
    hoverlabel = list(font = list(family = "Reem Kufi")
                 
))

# Add the CSS as a dependency for the plotly plot:
dumbbell_plot_first_last_ggplotly$dependencies <- c(
  dumbbell_plot_first_last_ggplotly$dependencies,
  list(
    htmltools::htmlDependency(
      name = "reem-kufi-font", 
      version = "0",  
      src = "",
      head = reem_kufi_css)))

# Display plot:
saveWidget(dumbbell_plot_first_last_ggplotly, 'dumbbell_plot.html')
```

```{=html}
<iframe src="dumbbell_plot.html" class="fade-inhtml" width="100%" height="800" style="border:none;"></iframe>
```
Â 

The size of the dots in the above plot correspond to the number of publications in that year for the addiction. After sorting the visuals with `ggplot2`, I used the great `ggplotly` package to make it interactive---hover over any of the dots to see more information about what was going on that year.

## Part 3

In groups of at least 2, pick one of the addictions displayed above and find some research on it.

Your goal is to find evidence that supports the view that people can indeed be addicted to the particular behaviour you choose (e.g., gambling, gaming etc).

-   What evidence do you find? Is there actual empirical data collected or is this just a commentary paper?

-   How do the authors study the "addiction" and what methods do they used to support the claim that the participants involved are addicted to their behaviour?

-   Are there any limitations of the research that need to be considered in this context?

-   Does the study make you more or less convinced that people can be addicted to this behaviour? Why/why not?
