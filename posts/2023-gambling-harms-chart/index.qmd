### Planning ahead

I (hopefully) have a long career ahead of me in gambling research, and I don't want it to be guided solely by the tide of publishing pressure. I want to do research that adds real value to the world.

With this in mind, I'm thinking about problem gambling prevention a lot at the moment and where to place my focus. To help with this, I've started mapping all the existing harm prevention strategies used in practice or proposed in the gambling literature.

To make the process a little more interesting for me and anyone who reads this, I've been playing around with the `plotly` R package to present my catalogue of prevention strategies in a visual and interactive way.

## Work in progress

Please note that I've only just started making the interactive chart and I'm conscious that it currently provides a **very incomplete picture** of the strategies available. I will be reading around and adding more strategies and information over the next few months (starting July 2023).

That said, please feel free to suggest some strategies or edits using the comments section at the end (or you can [send me an email](mailto:robheirene@gmail.com)).

### Prevention strategies visualised

Below is the catalogue of prevention strategies I have so far, visualised as a sunburst chart. Again, it's just a start, and I'm building it publicly so feel free to get in touch with ideas.

## Recreating the chart

I've included the `R code` used to create the chart in the drop-down sections below. Feel free to recreate it (the data are on the [Github repo](https://github.com/rheirene/Quarto_Website) for this site), but please credit me if you do :)

Hover over each category or strategy to read my preliminary descriptions, and [**click on the bars to see more**]{style="color:#289998; font-weight: bold;"}. It's best viewed on a pc/mac or tablet, **not** on mobile.

```{r results=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Install and load the groundhog package to ensure consistency of the package versions used here:

library(groundhog) # Load

# List desired packages:

              'plotly', # Add interactive elements to figures

              'htmlwidgets') # Make plotly plots HTML format for rendering in Quarto
              

# Load desired package with versions specific to project start date:
groundhog.library(packages, "2023-06-05") # Set Slightly earlier than start date as some of the plotly dependency packages wouldn't load properly with date as 07/07/2023

# Load new font for figures/graphs

         plot_bgcolor = '#002B36',
        hoverlabel = list(font = list(size = 12)))  # Increase the font size for hover text)

# Save plot as a HTML file (it doesn't render well with quarto otherwise):

### The evidence

As I (re-)read the literature on this topic, I'll also create a record of relevant studies and sources relating to each prevention strategy. **This section is even less developed than the chart, so the same call for suggestions applies.**

There will eventually be a lot of information presented here, so I've hidden the text for each prevention strategy inside expandable boxes for easier navigation.

#### Restrictions

##### Global loss limits

-   A survey (n = 2352) of Norsk Tipping (a Norwegian Government-owned gambling operator) customers' perspectives on the recently implemented global loss limit of NOK 20,000 per month ([Auer et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-018-9892-x))

##### Global stake limits

-   This [UK Gambling Commission report](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/guide/consumer-voice-2020-exploring-online-staking) discusses consumer perspectives on stake limits (n=32). Qual/quant survey with PGSI scores.

-   It seems that a lot of online gambling sites indirectly impose stake limits by having maximum payout amounts (e.g., Â£100,000). Payout limits vary from site to to site and across activities, but these operator-protecting restrictions (which are sometimes reduced for big winners...) can limit customer stakes .
